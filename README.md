# SoCoolBus
Bilkent University CS 491/2 Senior Project 2022/23
### Overview
As a group of five, we target to create a student-school bus tracking system named SoCoolBus that helps to inform parents about the location of their kids. By using SoCoolBus, parents can track their child’s location when they reach the school or home or if the school bus is stuck in traffic, and they will not get anxious about their kid. Also, this app helps bus drivers because before reaching the house of the kid, notification says that “It is close to reach there, please be ready,” therefore time will not be wasted for both driver and the kid. Additionally, drivers will get the payments and control the payments by using SoCoolBus.
